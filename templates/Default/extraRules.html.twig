            <h3 id="totem">Totem</h3>
            <p>Totem is a new keyword found on Spirits, representing the charms and fetishes used by Shamans to focus
                their tribal spirits and ancestors at a chosen site.</p>
            <p>Unlike a normal Spirit, when a Totem enters play it must be attached to a location you control, at which
                you have an unbooted Shaman. Some Totems may have further restrictions on the locations to which they
                can be attached, such as only to deeds, or only to your home.</p>
            <p>Any Shaman at the same location may use a totem, regardless of the totem's controller. A Shaman uses such
                a Totem in exactly the same way (and with the same clauses, costs or restrictions) as they would a
                Spirit attached to them.</p>
            <h3 id="kungfu">Kung-Fu</h3>
            <p>Kung Fu is a new keyword found on dudes which represents their training in the martial arts.</p>
            <p>A dude with Kung Fu will have a rating (typically between 0 and 4) associated with it which is added to
                that dude's value while he is in play. Having a Kung Fu rating also allows a dude to perform Kung Fu
                Tests and utilise Techniques as described below.</p>
            <p>When chaining techniques into a Combo, the dude's Kung Fu rating determines the maximum number of
                additional techniques that can be chained, beyond the initial technique. Although Kung Fu may at first
                seem similar to skills such as Huckster and Blessed, it is not considered a skill and is not affected by
                cards referring to skills.</p>
            <h4>Technique</h4>
            <p>A technique is a special kind of action card that requires you to choose a Kung Fu dude and have them
                succeed a Kung Fu Test in order to play.</p>
            <p>To perform a Kung Fu test, make a pull and compare its value to the value of the dude chosen (including
                all bonuses such as his Kung Fu rating). If your pull is a lower value than that of the performing dude,
                the technique succeeds and you use the ability on the technique. Otherwise the technique fails and
                nothing happens (the ability has been used to no effect, and it's the next player's turn to make a
                play). Any reference to "your dude" or "this dude" on a technique refers to the dude who performed the
                Kung Fu Test.</p>
            <h4>Tao Techniques and Combos</h4>
            <p>Tao Techniques are techniques that are part of a specific school or discipline and can be played in
                combination with other Techniques from the same Tao. These techniques will have their Tao indicated on
                the card (for example Tao of Zhu Bajie or Tao of the Jade Rabbit) and many also include a Combo
                requirement, indicating that you can quickly follow up with another technique before your opponent has a
                chance to make a play.</p>
            <p>After you successfully play a Tao Technique check to see if you have satisfied the combo requirement (if
                any) on the bottom of the card, if so you may immediately choose and play a different Technique of the
                same Tao from your hand or discard pile choosing the same dude to perform the Kung Fu test. Not all Tao
                Techniques are able to chain into subsequent techniques, but they can all be used to chain from prior
                Techniques of the same Tao. The same dude must be chosen to perform the Kung-Fu test for all Techniques
                in a combo and the maximum number of additional techniques that can be chained is that dude's Kung Fu
                rating.</p>
            <p>Unlike other action cards, a tao technique is not placed in the discard pile after resolution, instead it
                remains in play until the end of the phase in which it was played so you will not be able to use the
                same Tao Technique card twice within a single phase. A Shootout Tao Technique would be discarded at the
                end of the "Make Plays" step of the shootout, immediately before either player picks their shooter. A
                Noon Tao Technique is discarded at the end of High Noon, immediately before you check for a winner.</p>

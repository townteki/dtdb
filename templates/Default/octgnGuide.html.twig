            <p>You can play <b>Doomtown: Reloaded</b> online using the OCTGN platform. Doomtown plugin is coded by db0,
                most cards and actions are scripted, you can upload images, and it's generally pretty quick and easy to
                play online, once you're familiar with the interface. This guide will help you with that, it covers
                everything from installation to hotkeys.</p>

            <h2 id="1">Installation</h2>

            <p>First read the <a href="http://octgngames.com/doomtown/installation/">general instructions</a> on how to
                install OCTGN.</p>

            <p>Once you're done, go to 'Play or Spectate' and see if there are any open games of Doomtown available. If
                yes, Join, and if no, Create a game and wait for someone to join.</p>

            <h2 id="2">Gettin' Started</h2>

            <img src="{{ asset('/images/OCTGN.jpg') }}"><img>

            <p style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px"><b>The Golden Rule of playing on OCTGN:</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                If hotkeys are not working, make sure that the game board is active, not the chat window. Just click
                anywhere on the game board, and press the hotkey again.</p>

            <p>Once you're in the game, open "File -- Load a deck". Wait for your opponent to do the same and see what
                faction they're playing. See if you're okay with your starting posse. If not, right-click your Deck and
                choose "Look at -- All cards". Now manually drag the dudes you want into your hand, making sure that
                their combined cost does not exceed you starting wealth. When you're ready, press:</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; display:inline-block">CTRL+R - Ready!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Check the chat window to see if your opponent is also ready, say hi, and then press:</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; display:inline-block">CTRL+SHIFT+S - Setup</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Look at the cards in your hand. Now is your chance to use your Grifter's ability, if you have one in your
                starting posse. For that, hover the mouse cursor over the Grifter and press:</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; display:inline-block">CTRL+Z - Use ability</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You're all set now, so let's move on to the next phase:</p>

            <h2 id="3">Gamblin' & Upkeep</h2>

            <ul>
                <li style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; display:inline-block">CTRL+Q - Lowball</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When you and your opponent play lowball, if the hand ranks are different, the system announces the
                winner. If both players have the same hand rank, you need to determine the winner yourselves (i.e. four
                Aces beat four Kings in lowball; if both values are the same, compare the highest card).</p>

            <p>Now, if you see a red circle with an exclamation mark, it means that player cheated, and their opponent
                may punish them for it by playing a Cheatin' Resolution. Note that regular Resolutions cannot be played
                during lowball. If you cannot or do not want to play anything, pass:</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; display:inline-block">CTRL+Space - Pass</li>
            </ul>

            <p>After both players pass consequtivel, the lowball winner claims 2 ghost rock by pressing:</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; display:inline-block">CTRL+W - Win lowball</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Then both players need to pay their upkeep:</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; display:inline-block">CTRL+U - Upkeep</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you have a dude with upkeep (say, Steven Wiles or Bobo) and you don't want to pay their salary, you
                need to discard them. Either right-click a dude and choose "Discard dude", or just hover the cursor over
                them and press DEL. Note that if you actually cannot afford their upkeep, a pop-up window will ask which
                dude you want discard.</p>

            <h2 id="4">High Noon</h2>

            <p>The lowball winner gets a special red marker on their outfit card. They can now make the first noon
                play.</p>

            <p>To play a dude, a deed, or an action, just double-click a card in your hand. If you played an action,
                give the opponent some time to read the card, then discard it from the table (hover + press DEL). If
                it's a job, don't remove it until it's fully resolved. Some actions (and all goods and spells) require a
                target:</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; display:inline-block">SHIFT+Click - Target</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To move a dude, right-click them and choose "Announce move without booting" or "Announce move by
                booting", then manually drag the card to its new location.</p>

            <p>If you happen to take control of an opponent's deed after moving, right-click it and choose "Take
                Control". If it's the other way around, "Pass Control" to the opponent.</p>

            <p>To use a location (say, Morgan Cattle Co. or General Store), target a card in your hand (deed / goods),
                target a dude, then hover over a location and use its ability by pressing CTRL+Z.</p>

            <p>To trade goods between dudes, target the recipient and the goods, then right-click the current owner and
                choose "Trade goods to another dude" (or press CTRL+T). Remember that each goods can only change hands
                once per turn!</p>

            <h2 id="5">Shootouts</h2>

            <p>To call out a dude, target them, then double-click your unbooted dude at the same location (or
                right-click your dude and choose "Call out target dude".)</p>

            <p>If your dude has been called out, double-click him to accept, or press ESC to refuse and run home
                booted.</p>

            <p>If the callout is accepted, the attacker forms a posse by double-clicking on any dudes in this location,
                plus any unbooted dudes in adjacent locations (double-click them again to boot them, and drag them to
                the location of the shootout). Once you're done, inform your opponent by pressing CTRL+R ("I'm Ready!").
                The defender then does the same.</p>

            <p>If you made a dude join but then decided that he shouldn't be in the posse, right-click him and choose
                "Posse/Job/Callout reactions - Remove dude from posse" (or press CTRL+N).</p>

            <p>If the shootout takes place in a private location, all intruders get a bounty on their heads. Hover over
                each dude and press:</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; display:inline-block">ALT+W - Bounty</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The lowball winner has the first chance to make a shootout play. Select any necessary targets, then
                double-click a card in your hand, or hover over a card in play and press CTRL+Z. If you've got nothing,
                pass. The opponent then does the same.</p>

            <p>Once both players have passed consecutively, choose your lead shooter (target your dude, usually a stud
                with the highest bullet rating) and announce the amount of bullets you've got in your posse in the
                following format:</p>

            <ul>[5 base + X] stud + Y draw</ul>

            <p>So, if you choose a 2-stud as the shooter, and you've got three more dudes in your posse, one stud and
                two draws, then you should say: "8+2".</p>

            <p>Now, right-click your Deck and choose "Draw cards to Draw Hand" (or press CTRL+X), and enter the
                corresponding number. Then, right-click your Draw Hand (in between your Play Hand and your Deck) and
                choose "Look at -- All card". Target (shift+click) any card than you want to redraw, then double-clicke
                of them. This will replace all targeted cards with new ones. To discard without redrawing, double-click
                any cards without targeting them. Discard down to five cards in hand, then close the window and
                double-click your Draw Hand (right-click it and choose "Reveal shootout hand").</p>

            <p>Once both players do this, draw hands are revealed. If the ranks are different, the winner is anounced in
                the log, along with the number of casualties the loser has to take. If the ranks are the same, both
                players have to take a single casualty, but you still need to determine the winner by comparing hands
                (four Kings beat four Aces).</p>

            <p>The lowball winner gets the first opportunity to play Resolutions or pass. Things can get nasty here,
                hand ranks might change and dudes might get aced before the final outcome of the shootout is determined.
                Remember that if during this phase one posse becomes empty (e.g. wiped out completely by Coachwhip! or
                Point Blank) then the shootout immediately ends without the opposing party taking any casualties at
                all!</p>

            <p>After both players pass consequtively during the Resolution phase, the loser of the shootout takes
                casualties first - hover over a dude and press DEL (discard) or CTRL+A (ace). Then the winner takes
                casualties if they must (if the hand ranks are tied, or if the loser plays Takin' Ya With Me or Hot Lead
                Flyin').</p>

            <p>After that, the loser chooses to either stay and keep fighting (say "Staying" or press CTRL+R) or flee
                (right-click any surviving dudes and choose "Posse/Job/Callout reactions -- Run home booted", or press
                ESC and move your dudes home booted manually). Then the winner makes that choice (even if the loser's
                posse flees or is wiped out). Remember that you can choose some dudes to flee and others to stay.</p>

            <p>If both players decide to stay, proceed to the new round of shootout (start with making Shootout plays).
                If either posse fled or was wiped out, press:</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; display:inline-block">F10 - End the shootout</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Back to High Noon. If both players have nothing else to do and pass consecutively, it's time to move to
                the final phase:</p>

            <h2 id="6">Sundown</h2>

            <p>First, check the control state of deeds in case you forgot to change it after the last shootout or
                maneuvering. If you did, you can press:</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; display:inline-block">CTRL+C - Calculate control &
                    influence
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Finally, choose a card in your play hand that you don't want to keep (if any) and discard it. Then
                press:</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; display:inline-block">CTRL+S - Sundown</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This will refill your hand and unboot all of your cards in play. Wait for the opponent to do the same,
                then proceed to lowball (CTRL+Q). A new day has come to Gomorra!</p>

            <div style="border:1px solid black; padding:0 10px 0 10px; display:inline-block">

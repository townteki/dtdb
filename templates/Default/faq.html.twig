            <ul>
                <li>Winner (of Lowball), or first player clockwise from winner if winner has no dudes in fight gets the
                    first
                    opportunity to perform a Shootout ability.
                </li>
                <li>Shootout abilities must come from a dude in the fight, from cards attached to a dude in the fight,
                    from an Action card, or move someone into the fight. A player may use a React printed on any card
                    if the relevant trigger is met.
                </li>
                <li>A card ability may be used to move a dude into or out of a posse from/to the same location as the
                    shootout, as entering or leaving a posse fulfils the movement requirement of any such ability.
                </li>
                <li>Each player with dudes in the fight may perform an ability when it is their turn until all players
                    pass,
                    even if they have previously passed during this round of the fight. However, once all players have
                    passed the step ends immediately
                </li>
                <li>If at any point before casualties are taken there is only one posse with dudes left in the shootout,
                    the
                    shootout immediately ends and that posse wins . Card abilities may not be used to move dudes back
                    into an empty posse, as the shootout is already over.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="">Step 2. Pick Yer Shooter</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Any dude in each posse may be chosen, even if not controlled by the Leader or Mark. Card effects
                    may determine this choice.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="">Step 3. Draw!</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If the lead shooter has zero bullets, they contribute nothing, all other dudes, including those with
                    zero bullets, contribute 1 only, choosing a zero bullet dude as lead shooter if there is any other
                    option reduces your shooting ability.
                </li>
                <li>Players should determine how much of their Draw bonus they will use then discard simultaneously.
                    Each player may, if they wish, examine their opponents discarded cards, but only after revealing
                    their own discards.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="">Step 4a. Reveal</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Reveal effects apply first, before any Resolution plays can be made.</li>
                <li>Reveal effects are only applied to, or as a result of, the initially revealed hands this round, they
                    do
                    not get a chance to trigger during Resolution if a hand is changed by a Resolution effect
                </li>
                <li>Reveal effects happen simultaneously, if either player believes it matters, the Winner can choose
                    the order to process them.
                </li>
                <li>Reveal effects normally apply for that round, and continue to do so if the hand is changed</li>
                <li>The value of a joker is declared as part of Reveal and before Resolution plays. You may view your
                    opponents hand before declaring the suit and value of your joker, but once declared, it cannot be
                    changed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="">Step 4b. Resolution plays</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Winner (of Lowball), or first player clockwise from winner if winner has no dudes in fight gets the
                    first
                    opportunity to perform a Resolution ability.
                </li>
                <li>Resolution abilities must come from a dude in the fight, from cards attached to a dude in the fight,
                    from an Action card, or move someone into the fight. A player may use a React printed on any card
                    if the relevant trigger is met.
                </li>
                <li>Note: Cheatin' cards are not React cards and are played during the Resolution step alongside
                    other Resolution plays
                </li>
                <li>A Cheatin' ability may only be used when another player has a Cheatin' hand.If you are the only
                    player Cheatin' you may not use a Cheatin' ability.
                </li>
                <li>Cheatin' resolution abilities require that a different player is currently Cheatin' and they haven't
                    already had a Cheatin' ability used against them to their hand this draw. A currently legal hand
                    cannot have a Cheatin' ability used against it, even if that hand was previously illegal.
                </li>
                <li>If a draw hand that was legal on reveal is changed as a result of a resolution ability, it may now
                    be
                    treated as a Cheatin' hand, the requirement is that the hand be Cheatin' at the time the resolution
                    ability is played.
                </li>
                <li>A player may only have one Cheatin' ability triggered by their draw hand per resolution step,
                    regardless of how many times their hand changes to or from legal to Cheatin' during that resolution
                    step.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="">Step 5. Take Yer Lumps</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Modifiers to hand rank are cumulative and last for the round</li>
                <li>Modifiers that take a hand rank below 1 or above 11 are still there but not counted for casualties,
                    modifiers back the other way have to bring it back below the minimum or maximum (ie if a hand has
                    rank 8, has modifiers giving it +6 and 2
                    it is still above 11 and counts as being rank 11)
                </li>
                <li>If hands are exactly tied, there is no winner or loser for that round, the leader chooses casualties
                    first.
                </li>
                <li>There is no suit comparison, two (eg) straight flushes with the same numeric values are an exact tie
                    regardless of suit.
                </li>
                <li>Each player must try to 'fairly cover' casualties as exactly as possible, you must discard one dude
                    if
                    you have one casualty (you cannot ace a dude for one casualty), and must ace all your dudes if
                    your casualty number is twice or more the number of dudes you have in the posse.
                </li>
                <li>The loser of the round first chooses all their dudes that will become casualties and what will
                    happen
                    to them. After nominating all their casualties, each casualty is resolved one at a time. Reactions
                    to
                    the loser taking casualties (Takin Ya With me, Hot Lead Flying) are played after the loser finishes.
                <li>When the loser has resolved their casualties, the winner of the round then chooses theirs and then
                    resolves them in the same way.
                </li>
                <li>Card abilities that happen when a dude is being discarded or aced as a casualty (especially
                    "healing" reacts) can change or prevent the discard or acing from taking place, this still counts
                    for
                    the purpose of fulfilling casualty numbers.
                </li>
                <li>Sidekicks attached to a dude selected as a casualty can still be selected in the same round as the
                    dude has not yet left play.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="">Step 6. Run or Gun</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Dudes that flee count as moving, even if the shootout is in their own home</li>
                <li>You may choose to have some dudes run and some stay, this can include the original mark if this is
                    a shootout resulting from a callout.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="">Step 7. Chamber another Round</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If both posses still have dudes remaining, another round of the shoutout happens automatically.</li>
                <li>If not, all shootout effects end and the game returns to where it was, or the job is resolved</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="general">General Rulings</h2>
            <h3 id="jobs">Jobs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The mark's location is defined during step 4, "Saddle Up", when the leader's posse moves. Even if
                    the mark subsequently moves (e.g. by Pistol Whip or fleeing under step 6), the job can still succeed
                    if
                    the attacking posse is there at the end of the job shootout.
                </li>
                <li>The attacking posse only needs one dude to remain to claim victory, even if the original leader dies
                    or is sent home
                </li>
                <li>If the job was created by an ability on a dude and that dude dies or is discarded, keep them to one
                    side until the job is resolved in case the job text needs referencing (they still count as having
                    been
                    aced or discarded for the purpose of other card effects).
                </li>
                <li>The Leader starting the job only boots if the card requires it as a cost (eg: A Coach Comes To Town
                    does not require the leader to boot, Ambush does)
                </li>
                <li>Remember that moving to the location of the Job does not boot anyone. Instead, dudes other than
                    the leader must boot to join the posse if they are not at the location of the mark, and the leader
                    must
                    boot if the job ability states that he must. Once the posse is formed, it moves to the location of
                    the
                    mark with no further booting required.
                </li>
                <li>It is possible to mark your own cards with jobs, as long as the job itself does not specify an
                    opposing
                    card. If you do, you cannot defend against the job, but other players can still choose to do so in
                    order to prevent the job from succeeding.

                <li>A dude may attach any number of sidekicks.</li>
                <li>The sidekick must be attached to a dude in the posse in order to be used</li>
                <li>Sidekicks cover a casualty in the same way as dudes do, they don't reduce the number taken, they
                    count as one.
                </li>
                <li>If another card effect checks the bullet rating of a casualty, a sidekick has 0 bullets</li>
                <li>Cannot be used to replace a casualty required by, for example, Pinned Down</li>
                <li>Can be selected as a casualty if the dude attached to has already been selected for that round, all
                    casualties are selected then each is resolved.

                    a requirement is not a cost, negating costs does not remove the requirement. All other clauses after
                    the first sentence must be done if possible.
                </li>

                    Searching
                </li>
                <li>When a card effect allows you to search for a card, you are not obliged to choose one you find. You
                    simply declare that you are not retrieving a card, and continue play (after shuffling your deck if
                    you
                    searched it).

            <ul>
                <li>You check for Unique status at the point of entering play, if while a card is in play another copy
                    goes
                    to Boot Hill (e.g. through Ace in the Hole) this has no effect on the card while it is still in
                    play, it does
                    make it harder to return the card to play (e.g. with Raising Hell).

            <ul>
                <li>If a Dude leaves a posse (e.g. Pistol Whip) and then reenters (e.g. The Stakes Just Rose), they
                    count
                    as entering the posse and receive a second bounty if for a job that makes you wanted or in a
                    shootout on private ground
                </li>
                <li>Card effects that add to a bounty may target dudes with no bounty unless they say otherwise</li>
                <li>The key to gaining bounty is the location of the shootout, not the location of the callout. If a
                    dude is
                    called out on private land, but the shootout takes place on public land due to a card effect e.g.
                    Rope
                    & Ride, no bounty is added.
